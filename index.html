                        <p class="lead ">In 2015 my daughter, who has a lot of my same struggles, was begining to have a difficult time in school. The typical studying and repetition were not producing positive results. I got creative and developed several apps to help
                            her. Using the authoring tool GameSalad, I was able to create and publish my first app, Alien Math Innovation. Soon after came, Coin Crusher, Doomsday Division, The Rainbow Rider, Booger Ball, and a spelling app unique for
                            just her school. These apps were extremely helpful to my daughter and sparked my interest. 5 years later, with the help of COVID, I find myself back in school attending Eleven Fifty Acadamy with hopes of becoming a full-stack
                            developer. The following is my portfolio of work from my time at Eleven Fifty. Please feel free to review and reach out to me with any questions. Thanks for taking the time to explore my body of work.

                            <p class="lead ">I struggled with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADHD) throughout my formative years, ultimately finding it impossible to stay interested in school and leaving following my junior year in college. Although my ADHD caused me to
                                struggle academically, it proved to be a perfect companion in my career as a performer, Speaker, artist, and educator. Since 1995 I have spoken to thousands of people, written 5 books, and published 7 educational apps.
                                It was while making my apps, such as Alien Math Innovation, Coin Crusher, Doomsday Division, and more, that I gain a greater interest in coding, UX/UI, product development, and distribution. All of the games I personally
                                created were developed using the authoring tool GameSalad. I was also the art director for the game Goofy Gophers. My hope is to become a full-stack developer, and with attending Eleven Fifty Acadamy I am on my way. Below
                                you will find, my core values, developer skillset, along with my other skills. If you have any questions or would like to discuss an opportunity, or project, please contact me.
